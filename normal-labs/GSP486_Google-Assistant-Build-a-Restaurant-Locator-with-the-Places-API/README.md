## Overview

[Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/#?modal_active=none) is a personal voice assistant that offers a host of actions and integrations. From sending texts and setting reminders, to ordering coffee and playing music, the 1 million+ actions available suit a wide range of voice command needs.

[Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/) is a lightweight compute solution for developers to create single-purpose, stand-alone functions that respond to Cloud events without the need to manage a server or runtime environment.

The [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) is a service that returns information about points of interest by using HTTP requests. More specifically, you will take advantage of the [Place Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details) and [Place Photos](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/photos) services to receive detailed information and photos of establishments.

By utilizing Cloud Functions and the Places API, you will build an Assistant application that takes in a user's current location and restaurant preferences to generate the ideal restaurant for them to visit, complete with names, addresses, and photos.

## Overview

Storing and querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. BigQuery is an [enterprise data warehouse](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/bigquery-data-warehouse) that solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let us handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.

You can access BigQuery in the [Console](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-web-ui), the classic Web UI or a [command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool), or by making calls to the [BigQuery REST API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest) using a variety of [client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries) such as Java, .NET, or Python. There are also a variety of [third-party tools](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/third-party-tools) that you can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data or loading the data.

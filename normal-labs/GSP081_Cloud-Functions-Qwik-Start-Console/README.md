## Overview

Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your Cloud Function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

Cloud Functions are written in Javascript and execute in a Node.js environment on Google Cloud. You can take your Cloud Function and run it in any standard Node.js runtime which makes both portability and local testing a breeze.

## Cloud Functions

- Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services.
- The code executes in a fully managed environment and it's no need to provision any infrastructure.
- Cloud Functions triggered by the Cloud Events (things that happen in the cloud environment).

## Overview

In this lab, you explore the use of the What-If Tool (WIT) for image recognition models. Your task is to predict whether a person is smiling. The lab provides a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is trained on a subset of [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and visualizes the results on a separate test subset.

Objectives:

- Launch an AI Platform Notebook.
- Download the pre-trained Keras model.
- Define helper functions for dataset conversion from csv to tf.
- Load the csv file into pandas dataframe and process it for WIT.
- Load the Keras models.
- Define the custom predict function for WIT.

## What-If Tool

We can use the What-If Tool (WIT) within notebook environments to inspect AI Platform Prediction models through an interactive dashboard.

- An extension in Jupyter, Colaboratory, and Cloud AI Platform notebooks.
- Integrates with TensorBoard, Jupyter notebooks, Colab notebooks, and JupyterHub.
- Pre-installed on Notebooks TensorFlow instances.
- Used to analyze classification or regression models on datapoints as inputs directly from within the notebook.

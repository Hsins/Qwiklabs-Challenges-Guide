## Overview

[Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/#?modal_active=none) is a personal voice assistant that offers a host of actions and integrations. From sending texts and setting reminders, to ordering coffee and playing music, the 1 million+ actions available suit a wide range of voice command needs.

[Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/) is a lightweight compute solution for developers to create single-purpose, stand-alone functions that respond to Cloud events without the need to manage a server or runtime environment.

The [Youtube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) allows you to access millions of Youtube videos and their associated metadata through HTTP requests.

By utilizing Cloud Functions and the Youtube Data API, you will build an Assistant application that takes in a user's favorite music artist and generates their top ranking songs with links and thumbnails.

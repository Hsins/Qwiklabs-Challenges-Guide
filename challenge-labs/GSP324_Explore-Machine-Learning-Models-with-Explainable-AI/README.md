## Overview

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the [Explore Machine Learning Models with Explainable AI](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/126) quest.

Topics tested:

- Launching an AI Platform Notebook
- Downloading and exploring a sample dataset
- Building and training two different TensorFlow models
- Deploying models to the Cloud AI Platform
- Using the What-If Tool to compare the models

## Challenge Scenario

You are a curious coder who wants to explore biases in public datasets using the What-If Tool. You decide to pull some mortgage [data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/) to train a couple of machine learning models to predict whether an applicant will be granted a loan. You specifically want to investigate how the two models perform when they are trained on different proportions of males and females in the datasets, and visualize their differences in the What-If Tool.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don‚Äôt expect step-by-step guides.
